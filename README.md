# Data-driven investment strategies using Bayesian inference in regime switching models #
This repository contains the code and data associated with the paper "Data Driven Investment Strategies Using Bayesian Inference in Regime Switching Models". The repository is organized to facilitate the reproduction of the figures and tables presented in the paper.

## Repository Structure ##
The repository is organized into the following folders:

* [inference_mahmm/](https://github.com/elchd/Data_driven_investment_strategies_using_Bayesian_inference_in_regime_switching_models/tree/main/inference_mahmm): Python modules implementing the methods and algorithms described in the paper.
* [2_ Model settings and statistical learning procedure/](https://github.com/elchd/Data_driven_investment_strategies_using_Bayesian_inference_in_regime_switching_models/tree/main/2_%20Model%20settings%20and%20statistical%20learning%20procedure): figures from Section 2 of the paper.
* [4_ Simulation experiments on the impact of L and strategies/](https://github.com/elchd/Data_driven_investment_strategies_using_Bayesian_inference_in_regime_switching_models/tree/main/4_%20Simulation%20experiments%20on%20the%20impact%20of%20L%20and%20strategies): figures, tables, and related data from Section 4 (applications on simulations) of the paper.
* [5_ Results and investment strategies on real data/](https://github.com/elchd/Data_driven_investment_strategies_using_Bayesian_inference_in_regime_switching_models/tree/main/5_%20Results%20and%20investment%20strategies%20on%20real%20data): figures, tables, and related data from Section 5 (applications on real data) of the paper.
